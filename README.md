## My process

I started with the layout of the profile card then I configured each elements to match the design. I found some difficulties in positioning the profile picture but with the help from my brother who is a full-stack developer, I finally solved it. Generally, I satisfy with my codes though there are rooms for improvement.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Bootstrap


### Continued development

This project is my first project ever and so there are many rooms for improvement. One thing is I think I used too much hard-coding which is not good for real life projects where you need responsive works.
